# Script a Day: Solving Real-World Scenarios

Welcome to **Script a Day**, a repository dedicated to tackling real-world scenarios through scripting. Each day, I take on a practical problem, develop a solution, and refine it with a focus on best practices and real-world applicability. This project reflects my expertise in **DevOps, Cloud Computing, and Backend Development**, with an emphasis on automation, scalability, and efficiency.

## Objectives
- Solve practical challenges inspired by real-world use cases.
- Build a portfolio showcasing skills in **DevOps**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **backend scripting**.
- Continuously improve solutions through feedback and iteration.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into daily folders, each containing:
- **Script:** The solution to the day's challenge.
- **Documentation:** A `README.md` explaining the scenario, solution, and insights.


## Focus Areas
This repository addresses real-world scenarios across various domains:
1. **DevOps and Automation:**
   - Automating CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitLab CI.
   - Streamlining deployments using Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
   - Automating repetitive tasks with Bash and Python scripts.

2. **Cloud Computing:**
   - Solving deployment challenges on Azure AKS and OpenStack.
   - Optimizing cloud environments for scalability and cost efficiency.

3. **Monitoring and Observability:**
   - Setting up real-time monitoring with Grafana, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch.
   - Building solutions for log parsing and metrics visualization.

4. **Backend Development:**
   - Scripting APIs and services using Spring Boot, Lumen, and Python.
   - Managing database operations with PostgreSQL and Redis.
