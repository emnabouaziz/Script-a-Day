# Script a Day: Solving Real-World Scenarios in DevOps, Cloud, and Data Engineering

Welcome to **Script a Day**, a project where I solve real-world scenarios using scripting, with a focus on **DevOps**, **Cloud Computing**, **Data Engineering**, and **Software Development**. Each challenge is designed to address practical, industry-relevant problems and leverage modern tools and technologies.

## Project Objective
- **Solve real-world problems** using practical scripting solutions.
- **Explore advanced technologies** such as Kafka, Terraform, Jenkins, Elasticsearch, Kubernetes, Redis, etc.
- Continuously **improve and optimize** solutions with feedback.

### Example of a Challenge:
**Day 1: Automating Kafka Setup and Message Processing**
- Set up a complete Kafka environment with producers and consumers using Docker and Kafka CLI.

## Technologies and Concepts Explored
This project involves real-world scenarios across multiple areas of technology:

1. **DevOps & Automation**:
   - **CI/CD pipelines** with **Jenkins** and **GitLab CI**.
   - Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform**, **Ansible**.
   - **Docker** and **Kubernetes** automation.

2. **Cloud Computing**:
   - Provisioning cloud resources with **AWS**, **Azure**, and **OpenStack**.
   - **Automating cloud services** and scaling infrastructure.

3. **Data Engineering**:
   - **Stream processing** with **Apache Kafka**.
   - Real-time data analytics with **Apache Spark**.

4. **Monitoring & Observability**:
   - Setting up **Grafana**, **Prometheus**, and **Elasticsearch** for monitoring and log analysis.

5. **Backend Development**:
   - Building microservices with **Spring Boot**, **Lumen**, and **Node.js**.
   - Integrating **Redis** for caching and **PostgreSQL** for database management.
